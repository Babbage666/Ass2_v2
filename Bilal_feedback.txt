Hi Jon,

 

Black box tests are all good; however, the white box tests also seem to be very close to the abstraction levels of the
 Black box test. Scope of black-box vs white box testing is I/O vs Code coverage respectively. At the design stage,
 you will have more confidence and certainty about the Black Box tests as they are very close to the requirements
 and input outputs of the program. White box test, on the other hand, is the developer’s/coder’s test for example, 
in  UC34: White box test with criteria “Check a year range which is known to have no results, such as 1900 to 1910…..” 
is a good white box test. But you need to test all boundaries that are covered by the if conditions in your code.

 

Similarly, In UC16, the white box test case for calculating the cumulative count/performance is also a valid white box
 test as it is testing the implementation of the formula within the code.

 

The rest of the test cases seem to be I/O related therefore I will consider them as Black box instead of white.

 

I recommend keeping the test report in the current state and coming back to it especially to white box test
 cases once you have achieved code completion. You will be able to reverse engineer some good white box test cases,
 mostly the ones that fail.

 

I hope this answers your query, we can discuss more about this if have questions.

 

Regards,

Bilal
